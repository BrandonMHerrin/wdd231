                This summer while visiting family in the Philippines.
                We decided to enroll our kids in pre-school while we 
                were here for seven weeks. This provided a good oportunity
                for the kids to see what school is like for kids in the 
                Philippines and see what school would have been like for 
                their mother.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our kids were invited to participate in the pre-school 
                prince and princess parade where all the kids from the 
                preschools in province were invited to participate in a 
                parade and competion.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was a fun experience for our twins especially for my daughter.
                who loved wearing the beatiful dress. The kids walked a parade route 
                and got to wave to all the on lookers.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was a got day and we all were sweating plenty, but we made 
                some unforgetabble memories. Life is great.
