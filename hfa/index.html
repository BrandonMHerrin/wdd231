            <h2>Who Are We?</h2>
            <p>
                We are fun loving chaotic family. Every moment
                is a new adventure. Personalities colide in the 
                beautiful tapestry that is life. We are the uniting 
                of two great cultures through love and understanding. We 
                embrace our American and Filipino cultures full squeezing all 
                the joy and greatness we can from this life.

            <p>
                We love spending time together. The moments we
                spend together are the most special moments in our lives.

            <h2>Where Do We Go?</h2>
            <p>
                We love exploring this amazing blue planet we call home. 
                We love to explore Asia, America, or Central America, whether 
                by boat, plane, or larger than life 15 passenger van.

            <h2>Why Do We Do It?</h2>
            <p>
                We believe that the greatest gift we have been given is the
                time we have together. We understand that life is fragile
                and that you never know how much time you have with your family 
                so cherish every moment.
