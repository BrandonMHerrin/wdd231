            <p>
                This was our second time ever visiting the park.
                It was a hot day, but we still had a good time. We
                arrived just before lunch, which turned out to have been
                perfect. Right after we arrived, lots of tour buses show up.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                The park became so packed with kids on school field trips from all over. 
                Being that we had arrived just before them we were able to walk around 
                the park and get our bearings and figure out where we wanted to go and 
                what we wanted to do before all the tours got there.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                When I say it was packed that is an understatement. There employees who 
                were assigned tour leaders and that they had signs with numbers on them 
                they would lead large groups throughout the park and to the different 
                shows and attraction.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                There were so many peopple that the show were often fill to the max.
                Ofter times the shows would run out of available seeting and people would need to 
                stand.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                We did our best to maximise our experience. We went to every show we could.
                The started off with a sea lion show, which was very funning. There was one sea lion
                with an attitude that just decided to stop obeying the most of the commands 
                her trainers. The performers tried to work it into the show but it was clear that 
                she was being just a bit stubborn. She wanted to play but didn't want to do what 
                they wanted her to do.
