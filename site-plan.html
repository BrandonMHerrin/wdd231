            <h2>Site Name</h2>
            <p>
                For this website I chose the name Herrin Family Adventures. I chose this name to 
                be clear on the content of the website.

            <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
            <p>
                To help family and friends keep up to date with the most recent adventures of our family.
                We have friends and family all over the world as I'm from the United States and my wife is 
                from the Philippines. We love to see the world and spend time with family.

            <h2>Color Schema</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Primary: #2A6352, which is a green color. this
                    will be used for the header and footer backgrounds as well 
                    as for text in the body.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Secondary: #F4EAE0, which is a lighter color, this color is used
                    as the main background.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Accent: #F76C5E, this is a coral color that will be used for buttons
                    accenting different things.

            <h2>Typography</h2>
                <h3>Logos and Buttons</h3>
                <p>
                    I will be using the Caveat font for the logo and for buttons. 
                    This is a more playful font that works well with the overall feel
                    of the website.
                </p>
                <h3>Headers and Body Text</h3>
                <p>
                    I chose to go with the Nunito font. I think it looks casual and works well.
